      <p class="body-lg">
        Palm Beach County has developed into a competitive market for GLP-1 weight loss programs, with clinics concentrated in West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, Palm Beach Gardens, Delray Beach, and Boynton Beach. The area's affluent, health-conscious demographic has driven strong demand for both traditional medical weight loss centers and concierge wellness practices offering semaglutide and tirzepatide programs.
      </p>

      <p class="body-lg">
        Most Palm Beach providers offer hybrid models combining telehealth consultations with optional in-person visits, making treatment accessible across the county's sprawling geography. Monthly program costs typically range from $280-$800 depending on medication type (compounded versus brand-name), dosage, and level of support included. Several clinics report 4-6 week wait times for initial consultations during peak season (January through March), when seasonal residents return and New Year's resolutions drive demand spikes.
      </p>

      <p class="body-lg">
        The market skews heavily toward self-pay programs, though some providers accept insurance for office visits while patients pay separately for medication. Telehealth-first providers have gained significant market share by offering same-day virtual consultations, home delivery, and aggressive pricing on compounded medications—some as low as $69 per week. The clinics below represent the spectrum of approaches available, from traditional physician-led medical practices emphasizing comprehensive lab work and nutrition counseling, to streamlined telehealth services focused primarily on medication management and convenience.
