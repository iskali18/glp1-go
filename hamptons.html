    <p class="body-lg">
      The Hamptons and Eastern Long Island GLP-1 market differs notably from other premium resort areas, maintaining a more traditional medical model with stronger integration into established healthcare systems. Programs are offered through hospital networks, multi-specialty medical groups, and dermatology practices across Southampton, East Hampton, Hampton Bays, Mattituck, Riverhead, and surrounding communities, rather than standalone weight loss clinics or med spas.
    </p>

    <p class="body-lg">
      Pricing for brand-name medications typically ranges from $900-$1,500 per month without insurance, though many providers accept Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance plans for qualifying patients—a distinguishing feature compared to predominantly self-pay markets elsewhere. The emphasis on FDA-approved brand-name medications (Wegovy, Zepbound, Ozempic, Mounjaro) over compounded alternatives reflects the area's medical conservatism and integration with larger healthcare institutions that prioritize pharmaceutical-grade treatments.
    </p>

    <p class="body-lg">
      Geographic accessibility can be challenging given the region's spread across Eastern Long Island, though several providers have responded with telehealth options and membership-based programs with 28-day billing cycles. The market serves both year-round residents and seasonal populations, with some practices offering extended hours and weekend availability during summer months. Below you'll find a mix of independent medical practices and providers affiliated with larger health systems, offering varying levels of support from basic medication management to comprehensive programs including nutrition counseling, labs, and ongoing medical monitoring.
